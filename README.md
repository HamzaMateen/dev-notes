# Dev_Notes

Inspired by @charliegerard's [repo](https://github.com/charliegerard/dev-notes) (being inspired by repos of [@jbranchaud](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til) and [@thoughtbot](https://github.com/thoughtbot/til), in turn).

This repo is an archive of notes about the stuff I've learned.
It is as helpful as often I tend to forget this and that, especially there is a lot of things to master.

Something new is hoped to be written as often as it could.

Currently: 1 Dev_Note
